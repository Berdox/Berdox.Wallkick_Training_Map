# Wallkick Training Map

A custom **Titanfall 2** map designed to help you practice wallkicks. When you reach the end of the map, it will automatically **teleport you back to the start while preserving your momentum**, allowing you to seamlessly continue practicing.

---

## How to Launch the Map

1. Launch **Northstar** and enter the multiplayer lobby.
2. Open the in-game console by pressing the `~` (tilde) key.
3. Type the following command into the console and press Enter:

   ```
   mp_wallkick
   ```

4. You should now be launched into the map with the game mode settings I have set for it.

Alternatively, you can use this command to launch the map:

```
map mp_wallkick
```

This will launch the map in skirmish mode by default. You can use different arguments with the `map` command — a list of them can be found [here](https://docs.northstar.tf/Wiki/hosting-a-server-with-northstar/server-settings/startup-args/).

However, it's recommended to use `mp_wallkick`, as it automatically sets up the proper game mode options for you.

⚠️ If you launch the map in a game mode where you can use a turret or titan and then try to call them in, **it will crash the map.**
